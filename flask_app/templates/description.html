<h2>Description Page</h2>
<p class="green-text">My name is Fadil Ibrahim and this is my final project for CMSC 388J. Here is my description/proposal
  for the project: The website you are on is a social media / blogging site that will allow users to create posts and comment on other posts. Users will be able to register for an account and login. They’ll be able to view other users posts but must login in order to create their own posts and comments. There will be at least 2 forms for user management including one for registration and one for login. There will be others including at the least a post form and a comment form. I’ll be using bootstrap to make the project look presentable and nice, as well as Flask-Mail to send emails to users. As far as security, I will implement Talisman and a CSP that allows text posts and images and CSS. I’ll be using bcrypt for hashing passwords. Additionally, I will create a secret key and then include form.csrf_token in all forms created. I’ll import pyotp/qrcode and in order to implement 2FA. As far as blueprints, I will have at least 2 which include one for users and one for posts, as well as 3 pages for users and 3 for posts. Finally, I will simply create a description page that will include the description of the project and my name.
