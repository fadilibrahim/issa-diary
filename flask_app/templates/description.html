<h2>Description Page</h2>
<p class="green-text">My name is Fadil Ibrahim and this is my final project for CMSC 388J. Here is my description/proposal
  for the project: The website you are on is a social media / blogging site that will allow users to create posts. Users will be able to register for an account and login with 2FA. They’ll be able to view other users posts but must login in order to create their own posts. There are 5 forms, 3 for user management (registration, login, and update) and 2 others for posts (creating a post, and emailing posts). I’ve used bootstrap to make the project look presentable and nice, as well as Flask-Mail to send emails to users when they register, as well as for sending posts to other people. As far as security, I implemented Talisman, 2FA and a CSP that allows text posts and images and CSS. I’ve used bcrypt for hashing passwords. Additionally, I created a secret key and then included form.csrf_token in all forms created. I imported pyotp/qrcode in order to implement 2FA. As far as blueprints, I have 3 (main, posts, and users) with multiple pages for each.
